Test Runner Docker Images
=========================

This directory contains different implementations of test runner docker images.

### ant-junit
This project builds an image for running junit tests in a Docker environment via ant. It is a very lightweight solution.
Test classes to match can be configured in the build.xml - here `*Test and *Spec`.
